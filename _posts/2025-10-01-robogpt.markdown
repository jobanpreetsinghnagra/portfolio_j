RoboGPT is a robotics-focused AI assistant built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.  
It leverages high-quality vector embeddings to enable low-latency, semantic retrieval of robotics knowledge.

**Core Technology: Embeddings + RAG**

The system uses sentence-transformer embeddings with ChromaDB as the local vector store. This eliminates network latency and speeds up semantic retrieval during query resolution.

**Context Window Optimization**

Instead of fine-tuning a robotics-specific LLM, domain knowledge (ROS2 docs, robotics textbooks, Python robotics resources) is injected into the model context on demand. This provides high accuracy without additional training cost.

**Hybrid Compute Strategy**

Lightweight embedding computation is performed locally, while heavy reasoning is delegated to the DeepSeek R1 API.  
This balances throughput, latency, and cost while delivering high-precision robotic task guidance.
